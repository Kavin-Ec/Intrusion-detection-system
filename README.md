# Intrusion-detection-system
Abstract: 
 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software application to detect network intrusion using various machine learning algorithms. IDS monitors a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insider. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model or a classifier that is capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) from ‘good (normal) connections’. 
 
Attacks fall into four main categories:
• DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood 
• R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password 
• U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various “buffer overflow” attacks 
• Probing: surveillance and another probing, e.g., port scanning

Algorithms / Machine Learning models used: 
 
● Gaussian Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. 
 
● Decision Tree: A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes. 
 
● Random Forest: Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems. 
 
● Support Vector Machines: Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well its best suited for classification. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points. 
 
● Logistic Regression: Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds— that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure.
